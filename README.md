## Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

Welcome, glad to see you came across my Github Profile. 

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer by the Technical University of Munich. Currently, finishing a M.Sc. degree
through an exchange at NYU. I'm collaborating with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his 
research team at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/) on a project around high-performance multicasting 
on the cloud, aimed at aiding the potential transition of High-Frequency Trading current infrastructure to 
the public cloud.

Please, feel free to browse through my projects or reach out to me directly.
