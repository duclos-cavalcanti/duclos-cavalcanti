## Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

Welcome, glad to see you came across my Github Profile. 

I'm a computer engineer living in New York with a bachelors and masters from the Technical University of Munich. 
Currently, collaborating on independent research with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and [PhD. Haseeb Ashfaq](https://haseeblums.github.io/) from [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/) on distributed low-latency networking on the cloud.

The project revolves around [Jasper: A Scalable Design and Implementation of a Financial Exchange in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527). Beyond co-authoring and aiding in the development of Jasper, my [master thesis](https://github.com/duclos-cavalcanti/TreeBuilder) constructed a performant heuristic to 
select VMs based on present cloud conditions to improve Jasper's overall performance, both before and during runtime.

Please, feel free to browse through my repositories or reach out to me directly.
