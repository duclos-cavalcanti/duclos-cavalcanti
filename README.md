## Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

Welcome, glad to see you came across my Github Profile. 

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich, now living in New York. Currently, finishing the last credit for my _M.Sc. Degree_, also from TUM, via a collaboration with with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his research team at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).
The project revolves around [Jasper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527): a Scalable and Fair Multicast Solution for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud. Beyond aiding in the development of Jasper, my thesis aims to construct a performant heuristic to re-configure Jasper's multicast-tree based on present cloud conditions, that vary highly throughout time.

Please, feel free to browse through my repositories or reach out to me directly.
