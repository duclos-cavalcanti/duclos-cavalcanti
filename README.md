## Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

Welcome, glad to see you came across my Github Profile. 

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer by the Technical University of Munich, where I also am pursuing a M.Sc. in the 
same degree. Currently, at the very end of that program, I am finishing up the master thesis at NYU in New York.
Please, feel free to browse through my projects or reach out to me directly.
