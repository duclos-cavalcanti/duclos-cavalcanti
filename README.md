## Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

Welcome, glad to see you came across my Github Profile. 

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich. Currently, finishing an [M.Sc. Degree](https://github.com/duclos-cavalcanti/master-arbeit) through an exchange at the [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). 
I'm collaborating with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his research team at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/) on a project around high-performance multicasting on the cloud, aimed at aiding the potential transition of modern financial exchange's current infrastructure to the cloud.

Please, feel free to browse through my projects or reach out to me directly.
