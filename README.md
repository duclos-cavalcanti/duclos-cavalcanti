## Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

Welcome, glad to see you came across my Github Profile. 

I'm a Computer Engineer living in New York with a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. from the Technical University of Munich, in Germany. 
Currently, collaborating on research with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his research team 
at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/). 

The project revolves around [Jasper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527): A Scalable Design and Implementation of a Financial Exchange in the Cloud. Beyond co-authoring and aiding in the development of Jasper, my thesis constructed a performant heuristic to 
select VMs based on present cloud conditions to improve Jasper's overall performance.

Please, feel free to browse through my repositories or reach out to me directly.
