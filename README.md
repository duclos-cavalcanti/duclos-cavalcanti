## Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

Welcome, glad to see you came across my Github Profile. 

I'm a computer engineer living in New York with a bachelors and masters from the Technical University of Munich. 

I have collaborated on research with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and [PhD. Haseeb Ashfaq](https://haseeblums.github.io/) from [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/) on distributed low-latency networking on the cloud. The project revolved around [Jasper: A Scalable Design and Implementation of a Financial Exchange in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527). Beyond co-authoring and aiding in the development of Jasper, my [master thesis](https://github.com/duclos-cavalcanti/TreeBuilder) constructed a performant heuristic to 
select VMs based on present cloud conditions to improve Jasper's overall performance, both before and during runtime.

Now I am a SWE @ripple working on HSM adjacent rust code to enable performant cryptographic key storage and manipulation.

Please, feel free to browse through my repositories or reach out to me directly.
